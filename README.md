# Weather-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Model

Problem Statement:
The project aims to predict rainfall  using machine learning models based on weather-related data. The dataset encompasses various weather variables such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, pressure, and cloud cover, allowing for the prediction of whether it will rain the following day.

Approach:
Data Preprocessing: Transformed categorical variables, handled missing values by replacing them with means, and checked for outliers.
Model Selection: Explored various classification models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost and K-Nearest Neighbors.
Model Training and Evaluation: Split data into train and test sets, trained models, and evaluated performance using metrics.
Model Comparison: Analyzed and compared the performance of different models to select the most accurate one.

Model performance:
After evaluating several classification models, the Random Forest model emerged as the most accurate, achieving best accuracy score as compared to other classification model on the test dataset.
